Building an 64-bit operating system using dockers, vscode and qemue.

<!--more-->



This blog was actually an assignment given by our cow professor [Dr
Muhammad Imran Abeel](https://pk.linkedin.com/in/imran-abeel-6a517846).

# Build Your Own 64-bit Operating System

Today i will show you how you can build your own 64-bit Operating
System. But before the start of this tutorial you should have some basic
knowldge of computer programming laguages. You should have the knowldge
about the assembly language.


Here you can find the repo for the code
[https://github.com/imranzaheer612/Building-64-bit-Kernal.](https://github.com/imranzaheer612/Building-64-bit-Kernal)

## Setting up the enviroment

### Text Editor

You should have any text editor for writting and editting the code. For
this tutorial i am using the vs Code. You can download it from the there
[website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

{{< figure src="https://imranzaheer612.github.io/blog/vscodepic.png" title="vscode" >}}



### Docker

Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
from the website. But you shlould have WSL 2 backend. As mentioned in
there prequisites tab. Don‚Äôt forget to set the path for the docker.

{{< figure src="https://imranzaheer612.github.io/blog/docker.png" title="docker" >}}

#### Setting up WSL 2

Follow the following steps or can refer to this
[page](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-wsl2-windows-10).
Also visit the [microsoft
docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

-   ##### Enable Windows Subsystem for linux

Open the power shell as admin and run this command

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```



-   ##### Enable Virtual Machine

Open the power shell as admin and run this command

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```



-   ##### Install WSL 2 Update

The next part takes only a couple of steps.

Download the WSL2 Kernel update.\
 Run the installer.\
 When prompted for elevated permissions, click yes.



-   ##### Set the default version of the wsl

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
wsl --set-default-version 2
```



Once the installer has done its thing, you‚Äôll now have WSL2 successfully
installed on your PC.

### Qemu

Qemu is actually a virtual machine. You can download it from
[here](https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows).

##### Steps

-   Download Qemu and .iso
-   Add Qemu path to environment variables settings
-   Create an image
-   Starting the VM
-   Some problems you might encounter

In order to setup the qemu enviroment you can consider this
[link](https://dev.to/whaleshark271/using-qemu-on-windows-10-home-edition-4062).
You can skip the last step (installing ubuntu on qemu because we will
make aour own OS üòÉ).


{{< figure src="https://imranzaheer612.github.io/blog/qemu.jpg" title="qemu" >}}


## Building OS


You will learn how to make a simple 32-bit OS using docker, vscode and
qemu. I have attached an detailed vedio from [youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVahoidFA7F3Asfvamrm7w). You
can consider the attached vedios for detailed explanation.

### Imp Building Commands


#### 1. Make an Image

In this first vedio we will setup the Docker enviroment by making and
docker image using the command.

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
  docker build buildenv -t myos-buildenv
```



#### 2. Run the image

After coding your OS you need to run the image by entering the buld
enviroment.

Enter build environment:

-   Linux or MacOS:

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
docker run --rm -it -v "$pwd":/root/env myos-buildenv
```


-   Windows (CMD):

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/root/env myos-buildenv
```


-   Windows (PowerShell):

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
docker run --rm -it -v "${pwd}:/root/env" myos-buildenv
```


 \* NOTE: If you are having trouble with an unshared drive, ensure your
docker daemon has access to the drive you're development environment is
in. For Docker Desktop, this is in "Settings \> Shared Drives" or
"Settings \> Resources \> File Sharing". 

#### 3. Build

Enter this build command.Build for x86 (other architectures may come in
the future):

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
make build-x86_64
```

To leave the build environment, enter ‚Äúexit‚Äù.


#### 4. Emulate

After building the basic OS you can emulate the operating system using
Qemu: (Don‚Äôt forget to add qemu to your path!)

-   Use the follwing command to emulate the OS.

``` {style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"}
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso
```

-   NOTE: When building your operating system, if changes to your code
    fail to compile, ensure your QEMU emulator has been closed, as this
    will block writing to kernel.iso.

Alternatively, you should be able to load the operating system on a USB
drive and boot into it when you turn on your computer. (I haven‚Äôt
actually tested this yet.)


### Build 32-bit OS

We will make the 32-bit OS based on the concept of the **Real Mode
Addressing**. So thats why it will be easier to implement and later we
can extend it to a 64-bit OS.

{{< figure src="https://imranzaheer612.github.io/blog/realMode.png" title="Real Mode Addressing" >}}


We will make a simple print Funtion in c that will print some text on to
the screen. So, this will be just an intro about building a basic 32-bit
OS. In the next section we will discuss how to convert it to 64-bit OS
using the idea of protected mode addressing.


### Converting to 64-bit

As you can see we successfully build our 3-bit OS in the above section.
Now we are ready to change it to a 64-bit OS. The 64-bit will be diff
from the 32-bit one this is because we have used the **Real Mode
Addressong**. Now we will use the **Protected Mode Addressing**. As you
know we don‚Äôt use the physical address of the memory in case of the
protected mode but we uses the concept of **Virtual Memory**. We have to
build the

-   Discriptor Tables
-   Gloabl Discriptor Tables
-   Page Tables

{{< figure src="https://imranzaheer612.github.io/blog/protectedMode.png" title="Protected Mode" >}}


We will be using the multi level pagging. You can know more about the
multi level paging [multi level
pagin](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-paging-in-operating-system/).

{{< figure src="https://imranzaheer612.github.io/blog/multilevelpaging.png" title="Multi Level Paging" >}}

We will also use the C code to make some print funtion to print strings
and chars to the screeen.

## Output

We will use the **Qemu** to emulate our 64-bit OS. As we run our
**kernal.iso** file through the qemu we will see the output strings we
printed using the C code.

{{< figure src="/static/buildingOS/output.png" title="Output" >}}


 You can see i printed NUST log using the print\_str() funtion we built
using C. And here you go you have created your own 64-bit Kernel! Sounds
cool aha? 


Are you curious how i printed this styled text?ü§î You can make your own
using this [image converter](https://www.text-image.com/convert/).



**Hope it will be helpful**.
